# How to login into hastur.sci.utah.edu #

* If you are in SCI (UTAH) and want to find a linux machine to test my program, you can always 
login into my desktop `ssh -X hastur.sci.utah.edu`.

* If the previous method doesn't work, you can also try the FastX [link](https://hastur.sci.utah.edu:3443/login)
and login with your SCI ID. Because FastX uses VNC without encryption internally, a normal browser will complain
that the link is unsafe. Please ignore the warning and proceed to login. Once you login, you can click the cross 
sign on the top panel to start a session. Always choose the `MATE(Virtual GL)` as your desktop environment. This
will make sure you have a working environment for running OpenGL.
